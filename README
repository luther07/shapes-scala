9/9/11 - fetched changes from upstream, and merged upstream/master. 

9/29/11 - turning in assignment, only partially complete, still working on it.

10/06/11 - added default cases to match expressions in BoundingBox.scala in order to prevent MatchError exceptions.
         - when using pattern matching on cases classes you should always make sure that all cases are covered even if
           it means adding default case [Odersky, Spoon, Venners: 273] 

10/07/11 - I did make corrections to the tests in TestBoundingBox.scala, per the professor's repo
         - I added extra test fixtures for various combinations of coordinates and tested them
         - I made some changes to my case pattern match for Group
         - all tests are now passing
